# HueScripts
Web-based Philips Hue scripting application.

## How does it work?
Build the back-end using 'npm run build', afterwards simply open index.html!

## It doesn't really look that finished, is that right?
Yes, it is. I am currently reworking the entire website (which is live, see below) in TypeScript.
It is not yet finished, but in a runnable state. To run the 'old' version, check out below, the unfinished-but-working typescript rework can be built as seen above.

## Any live versions?
Yes, check out http://hue.jvpoppel.com
