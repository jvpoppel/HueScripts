# HueScripts
Web-based Philips Hue scripting application.

## How does it work?
Simply launch index.html and add commands on certain times. You can also add a music file to play with your script. For now, the application is quite simple and lacks a lot of functionality. When I do find time to work on this again, more functionality will be added.

## Any live versions?
